-- Computing Statistics of a list of numbers in Parallel   Threads vs Processes 

ThStat.cpp :

	Compiling : g++ -std=c++11 ThStat.cpp -pthread -o thread
	Running : ./thread <input_file_name

	The output will be loaded in the file out_thread.txt
	Time taken would be printed on the console itself.

ProcStat.cpp :
	
	Compiling : g++ -std=c++11 ProcStat.cpp -lpthread -lrt -o process
	Running : ./process <input_file_name

	The output will be loaded in the file out_process.txt
	Time taken would be printed on the console itself.


test.cpp :

	Compiling : g++ test.cpp
	Running : ./a.out

	The time in microseconds for each code over given input sizes is outputted into a time.csv file , this file was used to plot the graph.
